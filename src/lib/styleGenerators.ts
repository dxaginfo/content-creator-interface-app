<p><strong>Based on prompt:</strong> ${prompt}</p>
<p>This is simulated content that would be generated based on the selected writing style. In a real implementation, this would call an API to generate content using an AI model trained on the specific writing style.</p>
<p>The content would match the characteristics of the selected style, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tone and voice consistent with the author</li>
  <li>Structural elements typical of their writing</li>
  <li>Stylistic devices they commonly use</li>
  <li>Types of examples and references they tend to include</li>
</ul>
<p>For demonstration purposes, this is placeholder text. In the actual implementation, you would see unique content generated for each prompt and style combination.</p>`;
